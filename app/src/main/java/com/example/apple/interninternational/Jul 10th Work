TARGET FOR TODAY:
Finish the entire work flow of the Login, Companies module. This includes the DB interaction as well.





WORK PLAN:
- User will be asked to take some action regarding login in one standalone activity
- User can choose either to login, register or skip
- On choosing either of the above, they will be taken to the main screen (which we already have designed)
- Based on the choice made in the previous activity, few things will be changed dynamically in the navigation drawer
- Possible flows
    LOGIN - REGISTER - HOMESCREEN
    LOGIN - HOMESCREEN (with login validations)
    LOGIN - HOMESCREEN (without validations)
- There must be two types of communications with MySQL server
    Fetch - for login
    Insert - for register
- Both the above communications must happen in background and we will choose AsyncTaskLoader for this purpose. This is because loaders are
  immune to configuration changes such as orientation changes
- In case of login, the inputs will be username and password. Based on these, I need an output whether they are TRUE or FASLE.






Work Done:
UI is all done for the login screen. The flow seems to be working fine as of now.
