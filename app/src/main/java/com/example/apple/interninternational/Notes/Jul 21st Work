TODO
+ Display the images for respective countries
+ The images should be stored only in the internal memory when downloaded
+ Each country may need around, say, 4 images
+ The 4 URLs for all these countries must be stored in string-array or any other storage
+ When the country is clicked, only then the array of the respective country will be read
+ Use the contents of the string array and download all the images one by one
+ These downloaded images must be accessible by the activity as and when each image is downloaded
+ To achieve this, the loader must return bytes of data which can later be converted into original data
+ The pager adapter must be updated with the data set as and when each image is downloaded
+ Change the apply or login button based on user choice
