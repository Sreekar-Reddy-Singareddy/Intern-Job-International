COMPLETELY WORKING:
- InternationalDetailsFragment UI skeleton done. Content not yet programmed.
- Programmed the host activity (HomeScreen.java) action bar to show download icon whenever appropriate
- Created complete UI for NationalFragment.java class
- UI even populates the data getting the user inputs
- Basic programming of three fragment classes is done. They just populate the recycler views as of now

WORK PLAN FOR NATIONAL SCREEN:
- Need 4 fragments for 4 pages in pager view
+ 3 fragments display the list of items
+ There will only be 1 layout xml for all the 3 lists. This layout file will have 1 list view in it and nothing more
+ There will be 3 fragment subclasses to control the behaviour of the 3 lists
+ All 3 fragment classes use the 1 layout file itself
+ Each list uses different custom layout xml file - 3 custom files
+ There will only be 1 adapter class for all the 3 lists
+ The adapter constructor must take the custom cell data for each list and also the corresponding data source
+ There will be 3 bean classes one each for 3 lists (Branch, Location, Duration)
+ All this must happen with NationalFragment.java class as the origin
