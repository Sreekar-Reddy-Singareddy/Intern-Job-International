TARGET FOR TODAY:
Finish the entire work flow of the Login, Companies module. This includes the DB interaction as well.





WORK PLAN:
- User will be asked to take some action regarding login in one standalone activity
- User can choose either to login, register or skip
- On choosing either of the above, they will be taken to the main screen (which we already have designed)
- Based on the choice made in the previous activity, few things will be changed dynamically in the navigation drawer
- Possible flows
    LOGIN - REGISTER - HOMESCREEN
    LOGIN - HOMESCREEN (with login validations)
    LOGIN - HOMESCREEN (without validations)
- There must be two types of communications with MySQL server
    Fetch - for login
    Insert - for register
- Both the above communications must happen in background and we will choose AsyncTaskLoader for this purpose. This is because loaders are
  immune to configuration changes such as orientation changes
- In case of login, the inputs will be username and password. Based on these, I need an output whether they are TRUE or FASLE.






Work Done:
UI is all done for the login screen. The flow seems to be working fine as of now.
Created a custom login loader which takes care of database interaction.
Passing some input data, in the form of bundle, to the login loader.
Successfully made connection to the MySQL server and getting the data back to the client.
As of now, the connection sends some dummy data, just to verify if the code works fine. It works fine!
